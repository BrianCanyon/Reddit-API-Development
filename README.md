# Stock Analysis Data Aggregation and Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to scrape large amounts of text data from the Reddit API for
sentiment analysis. Starting with areas of work I am quite familiar with (API calls,
text processing, SQL, data vizualization) and move to areas I can bolster my learning 
(Apache Airflow, Docker, Flask)

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Local Data Aggregation (Data Engineering)
- Scrape historical stock related data from the Reddit API
- Store data locally in SQL
- Create and document schema, workflow, ect.

### Phase 2: Sentiment Analsis and Vizualization (Data Science)
- Query database and analyze data
- Implement sentiment analysis against text data
- Vizualize results from above two efforts

### Phase 3: Docker
- Document prerequisites 
- Containerize each element and push to VM

### Phase 4: Apache Airflow
- Integrate Airflow to keep database up to date and monitor recurring jobs

### Phase 5: Create API
- Implement 'Flask' library to create open API for this project
